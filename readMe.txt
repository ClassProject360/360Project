This is our project for TCSS 360. Everything in the code when compiled works correctly and the attached Jar file in 
the repo should run everything properly with File pathing on its own as well.

For the Judge the username is: judge and the password is: 1234
For the Administrator the username is: admin and the password is: 4321

When running the jar there should be a corresponding submissions folder with already submitted data provided. If this folder is deleted
the program will create a new directory and corresponding submissions when a user adds a submission. In the submissions folder we included
one graded drawing and one ungraded drawing to show the different states in the admin and judge panels.
